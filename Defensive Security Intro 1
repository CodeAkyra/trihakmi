"Defensive Security", known as the "blue team", is used to prepare and proactively
protect an organisation's IT infrastructure.
  - Preventing intrusions from occuring
  - Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

Some tasks that are involved in defensive security:
  - Cyber Security Awareness
      Training users about cyber security attacks, such as phising and social
      engineering
  - Documenting & Managing Assets
      We must kniw the systems within the organisation to adequately protect them.
  - Preventative Security
      Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems are the first line of defence.
    These devices controll what traffic is allowed to enter and leave the network
    and prevents malicious traffic from entering the network.
  - Logging & Monitoring
      Comprehensive logging of the network and system activity is essential in
      detecting a threat or unauthorised activity.
  - Framworks, Policies & Procedures
     Creating robust security policies helps ensure that the organisation's
      devices are used appropriately.

Security Operations Centre (SOC)
A Security Operations Centre (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals 
that monitors the network and is systems to detect malicious cyber security
events.

Some of the main areas of interest for a SOC are:
  - Trends & Vulnerability
      Keeping up to date with the latest trends and vulnerabilities in the industry
is an essential skill to help understand the risks an organisation faces.
  - Policy Violations
      A security policy is a set of rules that outline how an organisation's assets
are to be used and protected. The SOC team mnitors for adherence to these policies.
  - Unauthorised & Illegal Activity
      The SOC team establishes a baseline of acceptable behaviour and activity.
      Any deviation from this baseline is investigated Illegal activity exposes the
      organisation to higher risk.
  - Intrusion & Breach Detection
      No matter how well protected an organisation is, there is always a risk of a
      breach. The SOC team is responsible for detecting and responding to these
      breaches.

Digital Forensics
Digital forensics is the application of traditional forensic science processes to
digital devices. Digital forensics is used to preserve and analyse digital evidence
to aide in the investigation of incidents, such as a breach. 

This may involve looking at information from:
  - File System
      Analysing a low-level copy of a system's storage reveals much information, such as
      installed programs, created, partially overwritten and deleted files.
  - System Memory
      If an attacker runs a malicious program within the memory without saving it to the
      disk, the memory can be analysed to uncover details about how the program operates.
  - System Logs
      Log files provides plenty of information about what happened on a system. Even if
      the attacker tries to clear their traces, some traces will remain.
  - Network Logs
      Logs of the network traffic that have tranvesed a network would help answer more
      questions about whether an attack is occuring and what it entails.

Incident Response
Incident response is how organisation manage security events such as breaches, data leaks
and cyber attacks. An incident response process is a degined set of stages to minimise
damage, contain the threat and recover fast.

  - Preparation
      Creating the necessary resources and frameworks to handle an incident. This includes
      creating incident response teams, infrastructure to support in the incident response
      process, as well anything to help prevent the incidents, such as providing phising
      awareness training.
  - Detection & Analysis
      Using tooling and processes to detect incidents and assess their scope (reach) and
      severity. Logs can be analysed for suspicious events.
  - Containment, Eradication & Recovery
      Limiting thei mpact of the incident, such as preventing a virus from spreading and elmincate
      the cause and restore affected systems.
  - Post-Incident Activity
      Review the incident overall, how it was handled and could've been prevented. What were the
      learning points throughout the process? Do we need to provide further cyber awareness 
      training?
