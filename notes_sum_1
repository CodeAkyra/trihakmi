NETWORKING

LAN or Local Area Network
  End-points that are connected within the same network
Star Topology
  Devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as switch or hub.
  It's commonly found today because of its reliabilty and scalability - despite the cost.
  Downside is, the more the network scales, the more maintenance is required to keep the network funcitonal.
Bus Topology
  Relies upon a signle connection which is known as a backbone cable.
  Easy and more cost-efficient, but it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously requesting data.
  If the cable breaks, devices can no longer recieve or transmit data.
Ring Topology
  Less cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology.
  Less prone to bottlenecks.
  Easy to troubleshoot any failts that arise, but it isn't an efficient way of data travelling across a network, as it may have to visit many multiple devices first before reaching the intended device.
What is a Switch
  Designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet.
What is a Router
  To connect networks and pass data between them.
  Routing is the label given to the process of data travelling across networks.
  Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered.

SUBNETTING

Subnetting is the term given term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature network within itself.
  Example, 3 subnets
    - Accounting
    - Human Resources
    - Finance
It is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a subnet mask.

What is the technical term for dividing a network up into smaller pieces?
  Subnetting
How many bits are in a subnet mask?
  32
What is the range of a section (octet) of a subnet mask?
  0-255
What address is used to identify that start of a network?
  Network Address
What address is used to identify devices within a network?
  Host Address
What is the name used to identify the device responsible for sending data to another network?
  Default Gateway

ARP

ARP or Address Resolution Protocol allows a device to associate its MAC(Media Access Control) address with an IP address on the network.
Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices.
When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device.

ARP sends two types of messages:
  ARP Request, Wireshark ex., "Who has 192.168.1.100?". When the other devices receive that message, they will only respond if they own that IP address and will send an ARP reply with its MAC address.
  ARP Reply, Wireshark ex., "192.168.1.100 is at 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
The requesting device can now remember this mapping and store it in its ARP cahse for future use.

What does ARP stand for?
  Address Resolution Protocol
What category of ARP Packet asks a device whether or not it has a specific IP address?
  Request
What address is used as a physical identifier for a device on a network?
  MAC Address
What address is used as a logical identifier for a device on a network?
  IP Address

DHCP

IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device, or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.
There is a process called DORA(Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge) in which a DHCP clients finds a DHCP server by sending out a request (Discover), then the DHCP server replies back with an IP address to the device could use (Offer), then the client sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP address (Request), lastly, the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging that the process is complete and now the client can now start using the IP address (Acknowledge).

What type of DHCP packet is used by a device to retrieve an IP address?
  DHCP Discover
What type of DHCP packet does a device send once it has been offered an IP address by the DHCP server?
  DHCP Request
Finally, what is the last DHCP packet that is sent to a device from a DHCP server?
  DHCP ACK

OSI Model

OSI Model or Open Systems Interconnection Model is an essential mdoel used in networking.
It provides a framework dictating how a ll networked devices will send, recive and interpret data.

It consists of seven layer and has a different set of responsibilities arranged from Layer 7 to Layer 1.

  7. Application
  6. Presentation
  5. Session
  4. Transport
  3. Network
  2. Data Link
  1. Physical

What does the "OSI" in "OSI Model" stand for?
  Open Systems Interconnection
How many layers (in digits) dose the OSI model have?
  7
What is the key term for when pieces of information get added to data?
  Encapsulation

PHYSICAL LAYER
Refers to the physical components of the hardware used in networking.
Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system (1's and 0's)

What is the name of the numbering system that is both 0's and 1's?
  Binary
What is the name of the cable that are used to connect devices?
  Ethernet Cables

DATA LINK
The data link layer is responsible for handling the physical addressing of data during transmission. 
It takes packets from the network layer—which already contain the destination’s IP address—and adds the MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving device. 
Every network-capable device has a Network Interface Card (NIC) with a unique MAC address assigned by the manufacturer. 
These addresses are permanently encoded into the hardware, meaning they cannot be changed, though they can be spoofed.
When data is transmitted across a network, it is the MAC address, not the IP address, that determines the exact destination at the physical level. 
The data link layer is also responsible for formatting the data so it can be transmitted properly over the physical medium.

What is the name of the peice of hardware that all networked devices come with?
  NIC or Network Interface Card

NETWORK
The network layer (Layer 3) is responsible for routing data and reassembling smaller chunks into larger ones.
Routing determines the most optimal path for data to travel across a network.
Specific routing protocols like OSPF and RIP define what “optimal” means, though only their names need to be known at this level.
Several factors influence the chosen route.
One factor is the shortest path, meaning the route with the fewest devices or hops.
Another factor is reliability, based on whether packets have previously been lost on that path.
A third factor is the speed of the physical connection, such as copper being slower and fiber being faster.
All operations at this layer use IP addresses like 192.168.1.100.
Devices that forward packets based on IP addressing, such as routers, are known as Layer 3 devices because they operate at the third layer of the OSI model.

Will packets take the most optimal route across a network? Yes or No?
  Yes
What does the acronym "OSPF" stand for?
  Open Shortest Path First
What does the acronym "RIP" stand for?
  Routing Information Protocol
What type of addresses are dealt with at this layer?
  IP Addresses

TRANSPORT
Layer 4 of the OSI model is responsible for transmitting data across a network.
This layer uses two main protocols:
  TCP
  UDP

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.
  TCP focuses on reliability and guaranteed delivery.
  TCP reserves a constant connection between the two devices for the entire duration of data transfer.
  TCP includes error checking to ensure that data is received and reassembled in the correct order.

Advantages of TCP:
  Guarantees the accuracy of data.
  Capable of synchronizing devices to prevent flooding.
  Performs more processes to ensure reliability.
  
Disadvantages of TCP:
  Requires a reliable connection between devices.
  If one small chunk of data is missing, the entire chunk becomes unusable.
  A slow connection can bottleneck the receiving device.
  Significantly slower than UDP due to extra processes.

TCP is used for file sharing, internet browsing, and email — situations where complete data is required.
Data sent through TCP is broken into packets and reassembled correctly at the destination.

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol.
  UDP is simpler and less advanced than TCP.
  UDP does not offer error checking or guaranteed delivery.
  UDP does not synchronize devices or establish a continuous connection.

Advantages of UDP:
  Much faster than TCP.
  Leaves control of sending rate to the application layer.
  Does not reserve a dedicated connection on the device.

Disadvantages of UDP:
  Does not care whether data is received or lost.
  Unstable connections lead to poor user experience.

With UDP, some packets may be missing, resulting in incomplete data (such as half an image).
UDP is useful for small pieces of data like ARP and DHCP.
UDP is also useful for streaming media where occasional lost data is acceptable (like pixelation).

What does TCP stand for?
  Transmission Control Protocol
What does UDP stand for?
  User Datagram Protocol
What protocol guarantees the accuracy of data?
  TCP
What protocol doesn't care if data is received or not by the other device?
  UDP
What protocol would an application such as an email client use?
  TCP
What protocol would an application that downloads files use?
  TCP
What protocol would an application that streams video use?
  UDP

SESSION
The session layer (Layer 5) creates and maintains the connection between computers once the data has been translated by the presentation layer.
When a connection is established, a session is created.
As long as the connection remains active, the session stays active.
The session layer is responsible for closing the connection if it becomes idle or is lost.

A session can include checkpoints:
  Checkpoints allow only the newest pieces of data to be resent if information is lost.
  This helps save bandwidth because not all data needs to be retransmitted.

Sessions are unique.
This means data cannot travel across multiple sessions.
Data can only travel within the specific session that was created for that communication.

What is the technical term for when a connection is succesfully established?
  Session

PRESENTATION
Layer 6 of the OSI model is where standardization of data begins.
This is important because different software developers can design applications differently.
Despite these differences, the data must still be handled in a consistent way.

This layer acts as a translator for data going to and from the application layer.
It ensures the receiving computer can understand data even if it was created using different software.
For example, when you send an email, the other user may use a different email client, but the message should still appear correctly.

Security features occur at this layer, such as:
  Data encryption
  HTTPS when visiting secure websites

What is the main purpose that this Layer acts as?
  Translator

APPLICATION
The application layer of the OSI model is the layer users interact with most.
This is because the application layer contains the protocols and rules that determine how users work with data that is sent or received.

Everyday applications such as email clients, web browsers, and file-browsing software provide a GUI(Graphical User Interface) for users to access and manage data.

Examples of application layer protocols include:
  DNS (Domain Name System), which translates website names into IP addresses.

What is the technical term that is given to the name of the software that users interact with?
  GUI(Graphical User Interface)


Example of ENCAPSULATION with OSI Model
  1. Application Layer (7):
    Message: "Hello, how are you?"
  2. Presentation Layer (6):
    - Data translated or encrypted
    Encrypted: "H3ll0, h0w @r3 y0u?"
  3. Session Layer (5):
    - Adds session info (example: session ID 1234):
    [SessionID:1234] + "H3ll0, h0w @r3 y0u?"
  4. Transport Layer (4 – TCP):
    - Adds port numbers, sequence number, checksum:
    [TCP Header: Src Port 5050, Dest Port 80, Seq 1001, Checksum 0x1A2B] + [SessionID:1234] + "H3ll0, h0w @r3 y0u?"
  5. Network Layer (3 – IP):
    - Adds source/destination IP addresses:
    [IP Header: Src IP 192.168.1.10, Dest IP 172.217.0.14] + [TCP Header...] + [SessionID:1234] + "H3ll0, h0w @r3 y0u?"
  6. Data Link Layer (2 – Ethernet):
    - Adds source/destination MAC addresses and frame trailer:
    [Frame Header: Src MAC 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E, Dest MAC 5E:4D:3C:2B:1A:00] + [IP Header...] + ... + "H3ll0, h0w @r3 y0u?" + [Frame Trailer: CRC]
  7. Physical Layer (1):
    - Converts everything into bits and transmits over the medium (cable/Wi-Fi):
    010101101010110101010111...

For the DECAPSULATION, read the steps of Encapsulation from 7. up to 1.

WHAT ARE PACKETS AND FRAMES 
A Packet is a peice of data from Layer 3 (Network Layer) of the OSI model, containing information such as an IP header and payload.
A Framde, however, is used at Layer 2 (Data Link) of the OSI model, which, encapsulates the packet and adds additional information such as MAC (Media Access Control) addresses

A packet using this protocol will have a set of headers that contain additional pieces of information to the data that is being sent across a network.
  TTL or Time to Live - this field sets an expiry timer for the packet to not clog up your network if it never manages to each a host or escape.
  Checksum - this field provides integrity checking for protocols such as TCP/IP.
    If any data is changes, this value will be different from what was expected and therefore corrupt.
  Source Address - the IP address of the device that the packet is being sent "from" so that data knows where to "return to"
  Destination Address - this device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.

TCP/IP (THE THREE-WAY HANDSHAKE)
TCP or Transmission Control Protocol is another one of these ruels used in networking
It is very similar to the OSI model.
It consists of four layers and is arguably just a summarised version of the OSI model.
  Application
  Transport
  Internet
  Network Interface

TCP is connection-based:
  Requires a connection between a client and a server before sending data.
  Guarantees data delivery.
TCP uses encapsulation to add information at each layer; the reverse process is decapsulation.

Advantages of TCP:
  Guarantees the integrity of data.
  Synchronizes two devices to prevent data from being received out of order.
  Performs extra processes for reliability.

Disadvantages of TCP:
  Requires a reliable connection; missing data requires re-sending the entire chunk.
  Slow connections can bottleneck devices.
  Slower than UDP due to extra computing required.

TCP Packet Headers:
  Source Port: Random port chosen by sender.
  Destination Port: Port number of the receiving service (e.g., webserver port 80).
  Source IP: IP address of the sending device.
  Destination IP: IP address of the receiving device.
  Sequence Number: Number assigned to the first piece of data transmitted.
  Acknowledgement Number: Number for the next expected piece of data (Sequence +1).
  Checksum: Ensures data integrity via a mathematical calculation.
  Data: Stores the actual transmitted data (bytes).
  Flag: Determines how the packet should be handled during the handshake.

Three-way Handshake (Connection Establishment):
  Step 1: SYN – Client sends initial sequence number (ISN) to synchronize.
  Step 2: SYN/ACK – Server sends its ISN and acknowledges the client’s ISN.
  Step 3: ACK – Client acknowledges server’s ISN and sends first data.
  Step 4: DATA – Actual data is transmitted after handshake.
  Step 5: FIN – Packet used to properly close a connection.
  Step #: RST – Abruptly terminates communication if there’s a problem.

Sequence Numbering in Data Transmission
  Data is sent with random sequence numbers and reconstructed in order.
  Both devices must agree on the sequence to ensure correct data order.
    Example:
      Client ISN: 0 → First data sent 0 +1 = 1
      Next data: 1 → 1 +1 = 2
      Next data: 2 → 2 +1 = 3

TCP Connection Closing:
  TCP closes connections after confirming all data is received.
  Process:
    Device sends a FIN packet.
    Receiving device acknowledges FIN and sends its own FIN.
    Original sender acknowledges receiving FIN.
  Best practice: close TCP connections as soon as data transfer is complete to free system resources.

What is the header in a TCP packet the ensures the integrity of data?
  Checksum
Provide the order of a normal Three-way handshake
  SYN > SYN/ACK > ACK

UDP/IP

UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
  UDP is a stateless protocol.
    Does not require a constant connection between devices.
    No Three-way handshake or synchronization occurs.
  Common use cases:
    Applications that can tolerate some data loss (e.g., video streaming, voice chat).
    Scenarios with unstable connections where reliability is less critical.

Advantages of UDP:
  Much faster than TCP.
  Leaves control to the application layer for packet timing.
  Does not reserve a continuous connection on the device.
  Simple and flexible for developers.
Disadvantages of UDP:
  Does not guarantee data delivery.
  Unstable connections can cause a poor user experience.
  No connection setup or safeguards like TCP (e.g., no error checking, no data integrity).

UDP Packet Headers:
  Time to Live (TTL): Sets an expiry timer to prevent packets from clogging the network.
  Source Address: IP address of the sending device.
  Destination Address: IP address of the receiving device.
  Source Port: Randomly chosen port number on the sending device.
  Destination Port: Port number of the application/service on the receiving device.
  Data: Contains the actual transmitted data (bytes).

Key Differences from TCP:
  UDP is stateless; no acknowledgements are sent during a connection.
  Packets are simpler and have fewer headers than TCP.
  Focused on speed and efficiency rather than guaranteed delivery.

PORTS 101

Ports are an essential point in which data can be exchanged.
Think of a harbor and port: ships wishing to dock must go to a port compatible with the ship.
Ports enforce what can dock and where — if it isn’t compatible, it cannot dock.
Networking devices also use ports to enforce strict rules for communication.
Once a connection is established, any data sent or received will pass through these ports.
Ports in computing are numerical values ranging from 0 to 65535.
Because of the wide range, it is important to standardize which applications use which ports.
Standard rules associate applications and software with specific ports for consistency.
Example: Web browsers send data over port 80, ensuring all browsers interpret data the same way.
While the standard port for web data is 80, other protocols have also been allocated standard ports.

Common ports (0–1024) include:
  FTP (21): Used for file-sharing in a client-server model.
  SSH (22): Secure text-based login for system management.
  HTTP (80): Powers the World Wide Web; browsers use it to load web pages.
  HTTPS (443): Same as HTTP but with encryption for secure communication.
  SMB (445): Shares files and devices like printers.
  RDP (3389): Secure visual login to remote systems (desktop interface).

These protocols follow standards but can be configured to run on different ports if needed.
Example: A web server could run on port 8080 instead of 80.
If a non-standard port is used, users must specify the port number (e.g., http://example.com:8080).
Ports ensure that data reaches the correct application, enforcing rules like a “harbor docking system” for network traffic.
