INTRODUCTION TO PORT FORWARDING
Port forwarding is an essential component in connecting applications and services to the Internet.
Without port forwarding, applications and services such as web servers are only available to devices within the same direct network.
For example, a server with IP address 192.168.1.10 running a webserver on port 80 is only accessible to other devices within that network (an intranet).
To make the webserver accessible to the public over the Internet, the administrator must implement port forwarding.
With port forwarding, external devices can access the server using the public IP address of the network (e.g., 82.62.51.70).
Port forwarding is sometimes confused with a firewall, but they are different:
  Port forwarding opens specific ports to allow access.
  Firewalls control and filter traffic that can travel across those ports.
Port forwarding is configured on the router of a network.

What is the name of the device that is used to configure port forwarding?
  Router

FIREWALLS 101
A firewall is a device within a network responsible for determining what traffic is allowed to enter and exit.
Think of a firewall as border security for a network.
An administrator can configure a firewall to permit or deny traffic based on:
  Where the traffic is coming from (accept/deny traffic from a specific network).
  Where the traffic is going to (accept/deny traffic destined for a specific network).
  What port the traffic is for (accept/deny traffic destined for a specific port like 80).
  What protocol the traffic is using (accept/deny traffic using TCP, UDP, or both).
Firewalls perform packet inspection to determine these rules.
Firewalls come in many forms:
    Dedicated hardware for large networks or businesses.
  Residential routers for home networks.
  Software-based firewalls like Snort.
Firewalls can be categorized into 2 to 5 types, with two primary categories being:
  Stateful Firewalls:
    Uses the entire connection information rather than individual packets.
    Determines device behavior based on the whole connection.
    Consumes more resources than stateless firewalls because decision-making is dynamic.
    Example: Allows initial parts of a TCP handshake but may later block the connection if it fails.
    If a connection from a host is bad, it can block the entire device.
  Stateless Firewalls:
    Uses a static set of rules to determine if individual packets are acceptable.
    Sending a bad packet does not necessarily block the entire device.
    Consumes fewer resources than stateful firewalls.
    Only as effective as the rules defined; unmatched traffic is not filtered.
    Useful for handling large amounts of traffic from specific hosts, such as during a DDoS attack.

What Layers of the OSI model do Firewalls operate at?
  Layer 4 - Transport
  Layer 3 - Network
What category of firewall inspects the entire connection?
  Stateful
What category of firewall inspects individual packets?
  Stateless

VPN BASICS
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that allows devices on separate networks to communicate securely.
VPNs create a dedicated path between devices over the Internet, known as a tunnel.
Devices connected within this tunnel form their own private network.
Normally, only devices within the same network (e.g., within a business) can communicate directly.
A VPN allows devices from different offices to connect securely as if they were on the same network.
For example, devices on Network #3 connected via a VPN are part of Network #1 and Network #2 but also form their own private network where only VPN-connected devices can communicate.
Benefits of a VPN include:
  Connecting geographically separate networks:
    Businesses with multiple offices can access servers and infrastructure remotely.
  Privacy:
    VPNs use encryption to protect data, ensuring it is only understood by the sending and receiving devices.
    Useful on public Wi-Fi to prevent others from sniffing your traffic.
  Anonymity:
    Journalists and activists can safely report from restricted countries.
    Traffic may still be tracked by ISPs or intermediaries; the VPN’s effectiveness depends on privacy policies.
  Example: TryHackMe uses VPNs to securely connect users to vulnerable machines without exposing them to the Internet.
VPN technology has evolved over time and includes several protocols:
  PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):
    Provides authentication and encryption using a private key and public certificate.
    Cannot leave a network by itself (non-routable).
  PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol):
    Allows PPP-encrypted data to travel over networks.
    Easy to set up and widely supported but weakly encrypted.
  IPSec (Internet Protocol Security):
    Encrypts data using the existing IP framework.
    Strong encryption, widely supported, but more complex to configure.

What VPN technology only encrypts & provides the authentication of data?
  PPP or Point to Point Protocol
What VPN technology uses the IP framework?
  IPSec or Internet Protocol Security

LAN NETWORKING DEVICES
Router:
  A router connects networks and passes data between them.
  Routers perform routing, which is the process of creating a path for data to travel across networks.
  Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model.
  They often include an interactive interface (website or console) for administrators to configure rules such as port forwarding or firewalls.
  Routing helps choose the most optimal path when multiple paths exist between devices.
  Factors that affect path selection include:
    The shortest path (least number of devices between sender and receiver).
    The most reliable path (path with least packet loss).
    The fastest medium (copper vs. fibre).
  Routers are dedicated devices and do not perform the same functions as switches.
Switch:
  A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices together.
  Switches can handle many devices, typically 3 to 63, using Ethernet cables.
  Switches can operate at Layer 2 or Layer 3 of the OSI model.
  Layer 2 switches forward frames to connected devices using MAC addresses.
  Layer 2 switches are responsible only for sending frames to the correct device.
  Layer 3 switches are more sophisticated:
    They forward frames like Layer 2 switches.
    They can also route packets using IP addresses, performing some router functions.
  Example IP addresses in a Layer 3 switch setup: 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1.
  VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) allows devices within a network to be virtually separated.
  VLAN separation lets devices share resources (like Internet) while restricting communication between groups.
  Example: "Sales Department" and "Accounting Department" can access the Internet but cannot communicate directly with each other, even though they are on the same switch.

What is the verb for the action that a router does?
  Routing
What are the two different layers of switches?
  Layer 3 - Network
  Layer 2 - Data Link
