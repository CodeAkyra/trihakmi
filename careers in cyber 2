    A malware analyst's work invloves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports about their findings.
    A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language.
    This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C language.
    The ultimate goal is to lear about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

  RESPONSIBILITIES
    - Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
    - Confuct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled evironment
    - Document and report all the findings

6. PENETRATION TESTER
    Responsible for testing technology roducts for security loopholes
    You may see penetration testing referred to as pentesting and ethical hacking.
    A peneration tester's job role is to test the security of the systems and software within a company - this is achieved through attempts to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking.
    Penetration testers exploit these vulnerabilities to evaluate the risk in each instance.
    The company can then take these insights to rectify issues to prevent a real-world cyberattack.

  RESPONSIBILITIES
    - Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
    - Perform security assessments audits, and analyse policies
    - Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention
