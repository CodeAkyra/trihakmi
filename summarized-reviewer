NETWORKING

LAN or Local Area Network
  End-points that are connected within the same network
Star Topology
  Devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as switch or hub.
  It's commonly found today because of its reliabilty and scalability - despite the cost.
  Downside is, the more the network scales, the more maintenance is required to keep the network funcitonal.
Bus Topology
  Relies upon a signle connection which is known as a backbone cable.
  Easy and more cost-efficient, but it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously requesting data.
  If the cable breaks, devices can no longer recieve or transmit data.
Ring Topology
  Less cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology.
  Less prone to bottlenecks.
  Easy to troubleshoot any failts that arise, but it isn't an efficient way of data travelling across a network, as it may have to visit many multiple devices first before reaching the intended device.
What is a Switch
  Designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet.
What is a Router
  To connect networks and pass data between them.
  Routing is the label given to the process of data travelling across networks.
  Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered.

What does LAN stand for?
  Local Area Network
What is the verb given to the job that Routers perform?
  Routing
What devices is used to centrally connect multiple devices on the local network and transmit data to the correct location?
  Switch
What topology is cost-efficient to set up?
  Bus Topology
What topology is expensive to set up and maintain?
  Star Topology

SUBNETTING

Subnetting is the term given term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature network within itself.
  Example, 3 subnets
    - Accounting
    - Human Resources
    - Finance
It is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a subnet mask.

What is the technical term for dividing a network up into smaller pieces?
  Subnetting
How many bits are in a subnet mask?
  32
What is the range of a section (octet) of a subnet mask?
  0-255
What address is used to identify that start of a network?
  Network Address
What address is used to identify devices within a network?
  Host Address
What is the name used to identify the device responsible for sending data to another network?
  Default Gateway

ARP

ARP or Address Resolution Protocol allows a device to associate its MAC(Media Access Control) address with an IP address on the network.
Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices.
When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device.

ARP sends two types of messages:
  ARP Request, Wireshark ex., "Who has 192.168.1.100?". When the other devices receive that message, they will only respond if they own that IP address and will send an ARP reply with its MAC address.
  ARP Reply, Wireshark ex., "192.168.1.100 is at 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
The requesting device can now remember this mapping and store it in its ARP cahse for future use.

What does ARP stand for?
  Address Resolution Protocol
What category of ARP Packet asks a device whether or not it has a specific IP address?
  Request
What address is used as a physical identifier for a device on a network?
  MAC Address
What address is used as a logical identifier for a device on a network?
  IP Address

DHCP

IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device, or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.
There is a process called DORA(Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge) in which a DHCP clients finds a DHCP server by sending out a request (Discover), then the DHCP server replies back with an IP address to the device could use (Offer), then the client sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP address (Request), lastly, the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging that the process is complete and now the client can now start using the IP address (Acknowledge).

What type of DHCP packet is used by a device to retrieve an IP address?
  DHCP Discover
What type of DHCP packet does a device send once it has been offered an IP address by the DHCP server?
  DHCP Request
Finally, what is the last DHCP packet that is sent to a device from a DHCP server?
  DHCP ACK
