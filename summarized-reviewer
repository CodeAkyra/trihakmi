NETWORKING

LAN or Local Area Network
  End-points that are connected within the same network
Star Topology
  Devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as switch or hub.
  It's commonly found today because of its reliabilty and scalability - despite the cost.
  Downside is, the more the network scales, the more maintenance is required to keep the network funcitonal.
Bus Topology
  Relies upon a signle connection which is known as a backbone cable.
  Easy and more cost-efficient, but it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously requesting data.
  If the cable breaks, devices can no longer recieve or transmit data.
Ring Topology
  Less cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology.
  Less prone to bottlenecks.
  Easy to troubleshoot any failts that arise, but it isn't an efficient way of data travelling across a network, as it may have to visit many multiple devices first before reaching the intended device.
What is a Switch
  Designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet.
What is a Router
  To connect networks and pass data between them.
  Routing is the label given to the process of data travelling across networks.
  Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered.

SUBNETTING

Subnetting is the term given term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature network within itself.
  Example, 3 subnets
    - Accounting
    - Human Resources
    - Finance
It is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a subnet mask.

What is the technical term for dividing a network up into smaller pieces?
  Subnetting
How many bits are in a subnet mask?
  32
What is the range of a section (octet) of a subnet mask?
  0-255
What address is used to identify that start of a network?
  Network Address
What address is used to identify devices within a network?
  Host Address
What is the name used to identify the device responsible for sending data to another network?
  Default Gateway

ARP

ARP or Address Resolution Protocol allows a device to associate its MAC(Media Access Control) address with an IP address on the network.
Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices.
When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device.

ARP sends two types of messages:
  ARP Request, Wireshark ex., "Who has 192.168.1.100?". When the other devices receive that message, they will only respond if they own that IP address and will send an ARP reply with its MAC address.
  ARP Reply, Wireshark ex., "192.168.1.100 is at 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E"
The requesting device can now remember this mapping and store it in its ARP cahse for future use.

What does ARP stand for?
  Address Resolution Protocol
What category of ARP Packet asks a device whether or not it has a specific IP address?
  Request
What address is used as a physical identifier for a device on a network?
  MAC Address
What address is used as a logical identifier for a device on a network?
  IP Address

DHCP

IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device, or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.
There is a process called DORA(Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge) in which a DHCP clients finds a DHCP server by sending out a request (Discover), then the DHCP server replies back with an IP address to the device could use (Offer), then the client sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP address (Request), lastly, the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging that the process is complete and now the client can now start using the IP address (Acknowledge).

What type of DHCP packet is used by a device to retrieve an IP address?
  DHCP Discover
What type of DHCP packet does a device send once it has been offered an IP address by the DHCP server?
  DHCP Request
Finally, what is the last DHCP packet that is sent to a device from a DHCP server?
  DHCP ACK

OSI Model

OSI Model or Open Systems Interconnection Model is an essential mdoel used in networking.
It provides a framework dictating how a ll networked devices will send, recive and interpret data.

It consists of seven layer and has a different set of responsibilities arranged from Layer 7 to Layer 1.

  7. Application
  6. Presentation
  5. Session
  4. Transport
  3. Network
  2. Data Link
  1. Physical

What does the "OSI" in "OSI Model" stand for?
  Open Systems Interconnection
How many layers (in digits) dose the OSI model have?
  7
What is the key term for when pieces of information get added to data?
  Encapsulation

PHYSICAL LAYER
Refers to the physical components of the hardware used in networking.
Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system (1's and 0's)

What is the name of the numbering system that is both 0's and 1's?
  Binary
What is the name of the cable that are used to connect devices?
  Ethernet Cables

DATA LINK
The data link layer is responsible for handling the physical addressing of data during transmission. 
It takes packets from the network layer—which already contain the destination’s IP address—and adds the MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving device. 
Every network-capable device has a Network Interface Card (NIC) with a unique MAC address assigned by the manufacturer. 
These addresses are permanently encoded into the hardware, meaning they cannot be changed, though they can be spoofed.
When data is transmitted across a network, it is the MAC address, not the IP address, that determines the exact destination at the physical level. 
The data link layer is also responsible for formatting the data so it can be transmitted properly over the physical medium.

What is the name of the peice of hardware that all networked devices come with?
  NIC or Network Interface Card

NETWORK
The network layer (Layer 3) is responsible for routing data and reassembling smaller chunks into larger ones.
Routing determines the most optimal path for data to travel across a network.
Specific routing protocols like OSPF and RIP define what “optimal” means, though only their names need to be known at this level.
Several factors influence the chosen route.
One factor is the shortest path, meaning the route with the fewest devices or hops.
Another factor is reliability, based on whether packets have previously been lost on that path.
A third factor is the speed of the physical connection, such as copper being slower and fiber being faster.
All operations at this layer use IP addresses like 192.168.1.100.
Devices that forward packets based on IP addressing, such as routers, are known as Layer 3 devices because they operate at the third layer of the OSI model.

Will packets take the most optimal route across a network? Yes or No?
  Yes
What does the acronym "OSPF" stand for?
  Open Shortest Path First
What does the acronym "RIP" stand for?
  Routing Information Protocol
What type of addresses are dealt with at this layer?
  IP Addresses

TRANSPORT

Layer 4 of the OSI model is responsible for transmitting data across a network.
This layer uses two main protocols:
  TCP
  UDP

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.
  TCP focuses on reliability and guaranteed delivery.
  TCP reserves a constant connection between the two devices for the entire duration of data transfer.
  TCP includes error checking to ensure that data is received and reassembled in the correct order.

Advantages of TCP:
  Guarantees the accuracy of data.
  Capable of synchronizing devices to prevent flooding.
  Performs more processes to ensure reliability.
  
Disadvantages of TCP:
  Requires a reliable connection between devices.
  If one small chunk of data is missing, the entire chunk becomes unusable.
  A slow connection can bottleneck the receiving device.
  Significantly slower than UDP due to extra processes.

TCP is used for file sharing, internet browsing, and email — situations where complete data is required.
Data sent through TCP is broken into packets and reassembled correctly at the destination.

UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol.
  UDP is simpler and less advanced than TCP.
  UDP does not offer error checking or guaranteed delivery.
  UDP does not synchronize devices or establish a continuous connection.

Advantages of UDP:
  Much faster than TCP.
  Leaves control of sending rate to the application layer.
  Does not reserve a dedicated connection on the device.

Disadvantages of UDP:
  Does not care whether data is received or lost.
  Unstable connections lead to poor user experience.

With UDP, some packets may be missing, resulting in incomplete data (such as half an image).
UDP is useful for small pieces of data like ARP and DHCP.
UDP is also useful for streaming media where occasional lost data is acceptable (like pixelation).

What does TCP stand for?
  Transmission Control Protocol
What does UDP stand for?
  User Datagram Protocol
What protocol guarantees the accuracy of data?
  TCP
What protocol doesn't care if data is received or not by the other device?
  UDP
What protocol would an application such as an email client use?
  TCP
What protocol would an application that downloads files use?
  TCP
What protocol would an application that streams video use?
  UDP

SESSION

The session layer (Layer 5) creates and maintains the connection between computers once the data has been translated by the presentation layer.
When a connection is established, a session is created.
As long as the connection remains active, the session stays active.
The session layer is responsible for closing the connection if it becomes idle or is lost.

A session can include checkpoints:
  Checkpoints allow only the newest pieces of data to be resent if information is lost.
  This helps save bandwidth because not all data needs to be retransmitted.

Sessions are unique.
This means data cannot travel across multiple sessions.
Data can only travel within the specific session that was created for that communication.

What is the technical term for when a connection is succesfully established?
  Session

PRESENTATION

Layer 6 of the OSI model is where standardization of data begins.
This is important because different software developers can design applications differently.
Despite these differences, the data must still be handled in a consistent way.

This layer acts as a translator for data going to and from the application layer.
It ensures the receiving computer can understand data even if it was created using different software.
For example, when you send an email, the other user may use a different email client, but the message should still appear correctly.

Security features occur at this layer, such as:
  Data encryption
  HTTPS when visiting secure websites

What is the main purpose that this Layer acts as?
  Translator

APPLICATION

The application layer of the OSI model is the layer users interact with most.
This is because the application layer contains the protocols and rules that determine how users work with data that is sent or received.

Everyday applications such as email clients, web browsers, and file-browsing software provide a GUI(Graphical User Interface) for users to access and manage data.

Examples of application layer protocols include:
  DNS (Domain Name System), which translates website names into IP addresses.

What is the technical term that is given to the name of the software that users interact with?
  GUI(Graphical User Interface)
