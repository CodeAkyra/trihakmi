NETWORKING

LAN or Local Area Network
  End-points that are connected within the same network
Star Topology
  Devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as switch or hub.
  It's commonly found today because of its reliabilty and scalability - despite the cost.
  Downside is, the more the network scales, the more maintenance is required to keep the network funcitonal.
Bus Topology
  Relies upon a signle connection which is known as a backbone cable.
  Easy and more cost-efficient, but it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously requesting data.
  If the cable breaks, devices can no longer recieve or transmit data.
Ring Topology
  Less cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology.
  Less prone to bottlenecks.
  Easy to troubleshoot any failts that arise, but it isn't an efficient way of data travelling across a network, as it may have to visit many multiple devices first before reaching the intended device.
What is a Switch
  Designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet.
What is a Router
  To connect networks and pass data between them.
  Routing is the label given to the process of data travelling across networks.
  Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered.

SUBNETTING

Subnetting is the term given term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature network within itself.
  Example, 3 subnets
    - Accounting
    - Human Resources
    - Finance
It is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a subnet mask.
